The portuguese ID, known in Portugal as *Cartão de cidadão*, is the first part of the App.  
The algorithm is in the pdf file, along with this post, and has an example code in C#. 

* The portuguese ID is a string made of digits from 0-9 and english alphabet letters from A-Z. 
* The letters will be converted to numbers in the process. 'A' as value 10, 'B' as value 11, 'C' as value 12 and so on.
* The length of the string is always 12.
* This App is not case sensitive.
